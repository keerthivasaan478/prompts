Fraud Mitigation workflowSubtask 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing


Goal: Collect relevant data and preprocess it for analysis. Prompts:

1. Data Identification Prompt:

"Identify the types of data required to detect fraud (e.g., transaction history, user behavior, IP logs). Provide a list of
sources and formats for this data."

Output: List of data types, sources, and formats. 
2. Preprocessing Prompt:

"For the provided data, outline the steps to clean, normalize, and organize it for fraud analysis. Ensure missing values, duplicate entries, and outliers are addressed."
Output: Cleaned and normalized dataset. 
Feedback Loop:
 "Review the cleaned data. Are there inconsistencies or
data points that could skew fraud analysis? If so, refinethepreprocessing steps."

Subtask 2: Fraud Pattern Identification
Goal: Identify patterns indicative of fraudulent activity.
Prompts:
1. Pattern Extraction Prompt:
"Analyze historical data and provide common patternsor anomalies associated with fraudulent activities (e.g., unusual transaction amounts, frequency spikes)."
Output: List of identified fraud patterns. 
2. Correlation Analysis Prompt:
"For each identified pattern, analyze its correlationwith confirmed fraud cases. Rank patterns by their
predictive value."
Output: Ranked fraud patterns with predictive scores. 
Feedback Loop:
 "Evaluate the relevance of the patterns to recent fraudcases. Adjust rankings or add new patterns if necessary.

"Subtask 3: Suspicious Activity Detection
Goal: Flag transactions or behaviors that match fraud patterns. 
Prompts:
1. Anomaly Detection Prompt:
"Using the identified fraud patterns, detect anomalies inthegiven dataset. Highlight transactions or behaviors that deviatesignificantly."
Output: List of flagged activities. 
2. Verification Prompt:
"Cross-verify flagged activities with historical non-fraudulent
cases. Eliminate false positives and refine detection thresholds.
"Output: Verified list of suspicious activities. 
Feedback Loop:
"Reassess flagged activities based on expert feedback or
additional data. Update detection thresholds if false positivespersist."

Subtask 4: Risk Scoring and Prioritization
Goal: Assign risk scores to flagged activities and prioritize them. 
Prompts:
1. Risk Scoring Prompt:
"Develop a scoring system for suspicious activities basedonfactors like financial impact, pattern frequency, and user history. Assign scores to each flagged activity."
Output: Scored list of flagged activities.
2. Prioritization Prompt:
"Sort flagged activities by their risk scores and categorizetheminto high, medium, and low priority groups."
Output: Prioritized list of activities.
Feedback Loop:
"Check if prioritization aligns with actual fraud impact frompast cases. Adjust scoring weights if needed."

Subtask 5: Investigation and Root Cause Analysis
Goal: Investigate high-priority activities and determine their root causes. 
Prompts:
1. Investigation Prompt:
"For each high-priority activity, analyze associated datatoidentify potential fraudulent methods and actors involved."
Output: Detailed investigation report.
2. Root Cause Analysis Prompt:
"For confirmed fraud cases, identify root causes such as systemvulnerabilities, process loopholes, or user exploitation."
Output: List of root causes with case mappings.
Feedback Loop:
"Validate root causes with historical trends. Refine analysisif common patterns are overlooked."

Subtask 6: Mitigation and Prevention Strategy
Goal: Develop actionable strategies to mitigate fraud and prevent
recurrence. 
Prompts:
1. Mitigation Strategy Prompt:
"Propose immediate actions to mitigate the impact of detectedfraud (e.g., account freezes, transaction reversals)."
Output: List of mitigation actions. 
2. Prevention Strategy Prompt:
"Develop long-term prevention measures such as frauddetection algorithms, user education programs, and systemupgrades."
Output: Comprehensive prevention strategy. 
Feedback Loop:
"Assess the ef ectiveness of proposed strategies after
implementation. Gather feedback and refine strategies
accordingly."
3. Linking Outputs to Inputs
 Subtask 1 to Subtask 2: Cleaned and normalized dataset feeds
into fraud pattern identification.  Subtask 2 to Subtask 3: Identified patterns guide anomaly
detection.  Subtask 3 to Subtask 4: Flagged activities become input for riskscoring.  Subtask 4 to Subtask 5: High-priority flagged activities are
investigated.  Subtask 5 to Subtask 6: Root causes inform mitigation andprevention strategies. 4. Feedback Loops for Refinement
 Include iterative validation after every subtask to refine outputs
based on expert feedback, real-world testing, or additional data.  Use prompts like "Based on the results of the previous task, identify gaps or improvements required. Adjust the
approach as necessary."
