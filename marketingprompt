A woman wearing a wide-brimmed hat and a white sweater sits casually on the back of a central cognac leather sofa. The background includes a stone fireplace, large windows showing trees, and contemporary furniture. The lower portion of the image is dominated by a clean, semi-transparent mocha-brown rectangular text overlay containing bold white headlines and a call-to-action button, framed by a dark navy border. The aesthetic is aspirational, successful, and tailored for a home staging or interior design blog.",
