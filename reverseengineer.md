**1. Structure**  
The prompt is organized into four main parts:  
- **Manus AI Assistant Capabilities** (Overview, General Capabilities, Tools & Interfaces, Programming Languages & Technologies, Task Approach, Limitations, How I Can Help You)  
- **Effective Prompting Guide** (Introduction, Key Elements, Examples, Iterative Process, Code‑Specific Tips, Conclusion)  
- **About Manus AI Assistant** (Identity, Purpose, Process, Personality, Domains, Learning, Style, Values, Collaboration)  

Each part uses clear headings and sub‑headings to separate concerns—what Manus can do, how to talk to any AI effectively, and more background on Manus itself.

**2. Purpose of Each Part**  
- **Overview & Capabilities**: Sets expectations for the user—“here’s everything I’m good at.”  
- **Tools & Interfaces**: Tells the AI which virtual tools it has (browser, shell, file system, deployment) so it won’t try unauthorized actions.  
- **Programming & Frameworks**: Clarifies technical scope—languages and libraries Manus can handle.  
- **Task Approach Methodology**: Outlines the AI’s internal workflow: understand, plan, execute, adapt, verify.  
- **Limitations**: Guards against asking for forbidden or impossible actions.  
- **How I Can Help You**: A friendly wrap‑up, reminding users to state tasks clearly and promising methodical help.  
- **Effective Prompting Guide**: Teaches users how to frame questions so the AI gives useful answers—covering clarity, context, structure, output format, iteration, and code specifics.  
- **About Manus AI Assistant**: Adds personality, values, and collaboration tips to make interactions more human‑centered.

**3. How Sections Interact**  
The **Capabilities** and **Tools** sections define what’s possible; the **Methodology** tells the AI how to use those possibilities. The **Prompting Guide** sits between user and AI: it shapes user questions so the AI’s methods and abilities can deliver optimal results. **Limitations** stitch across all sections, preventing overreach. Finally, **About Manus** humanizes the whole setup.

**4. Plain‑English Translation**  
“Manus is an AI helper that can research, write, code, analyze data, deploy apps, and more. It knows how to use a browser, a Linux shell, and file operations inside its sandbox. Tell Manus what you need in clear terms—include background, format requests, and any constraints. Manus will break big tasks into steps, keep you updated, and test everything before handing it over. Remember: Manus can’t share internal secrets, break ethics, or touch systems outside its box. If you’re asking for code, specify the language, libraries, and examples. Interact iteratively—tweak your prompt based on what Manus delivers. In short, give clear, structured requests, and Manus will do the rest.”

**6. Suggestions for Variations**  
- **Concise Mode:** Trim the “Tech Stack” and “Workflow” to single‑line bullets.  
- **Conversational Tone:** Add “Hi, I’m Manus—let’s tackle this together!” at the top.  
- **Domain Focus:** Swap “Programming” for a custom “Legal Research” section if working with lawyers.  
- **Strict Process:** Insert an explicit “No tool call without a plan step” rule under Workflow.
